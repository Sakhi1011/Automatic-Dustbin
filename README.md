AIM
In many households and public spaces, traditional dustbins require manual operation, which poses hygiene issues, especially in shared environments.
Users must touch the lid or foot pedal to dispose of waste, increasing the risk of germ transmission. 
There is a need for a hands-free, hygienic waste disposal solution that is low-cost, reliable, and easy to implement using basic electronics and automation.

RESULT
The designed Arduino Unoâ€“based automatic dustbin system was successfully developed and tested. 
The system detects the presence of an object (such as a hand) within a specified range (20 cm) using the HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor. 
Upon detection, the MG90S servo motor smoothly opens the lid and holds it open for a short duration, even if the object is removed, before automatically closing it. 
This provides a contactless, hygienic solution for waste disposal.

A compact PCB was also designed using KiCad to interface the ultrasonic sensor and servo motor with the Arduino Uno.
The Gerber files were generated and are ready for PCB fabrication, reducing the need for a breadboard or manual wiring. 
The system performed reliably under real-world conditions, demonstrating its effectiveness, low cost, and suitability for public or household use.
